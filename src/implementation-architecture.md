# Implementation Architecture

This document explains the implementation shape of the
[`irodori-table`](https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-table) repository. It is
intentionally practical: use it to decide which directory owns a change, how
frontend code reaches Rust, and where shared logic should live.

## Goals

- Keep the desktop app as the product integration point.
- Keep Rust/TypeScript command payloads generated from Rust definitions.
- Keep shared crates small and earned by stable boundaries.
- Keep database execution, streaming, cancellation, and result paging in Rust.
- Keep UI workflow, layout, and interaction state in the desktop frontend.
- Keep extension contracts separate from app-only implementation details.

## Frontend Shape

The frontend is feature-first. Cross-feature composition happens in
`apps/desktop/src/app/AppWorkbench.tsx`, while feature behavior should stay in
`apps/desktop/src/features/*`.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  app["AppWorkbench<br/>composition and command wiring"]
  shell["WorkbenchShell<br/>chrome, menu, status bar"]
  stores["Zustand stores<br/>workbench/results/preferences/connections"]
  editor["query-editor<br/>CodeMirror, selection, params, magics"]
  results["results<br/>grid, WebGL, chart, BI, row detail, export"]
  connections["connections<br/>profiles, import/export, validation"]
  sidebars["workbench views<br/>Sidebar, Inspector, Git, history, completion"]
  dialogs["dialogs<br/>settings, ERD, migration, import, AI"]
  api["generated API<br/>src/generated/irodori-api.ts"]

  app --> shell
  app --> stores
  app --> editor
  app --> results
  app --> connections
  app --> sidebars
  app --> dialogs
  editor --> api
  results --> api
  connections --> api
  dialogs --> api
```

Frontend rules of thumb:

- Put user workflow code under the owning `features/<area>/` directory.
- Keep reusable pure SQL helpers under `src/sql/`.
- Keep global keyboard metadata in `src/core/keybindings.ts`.
- Keep command orchestration in `features/workbench/command-handlers.ts`.
- Keep large repeated UI surfaces under feature `components/`.
- Keep cross-feature UI primitives under `src/components/` — currently
  `DialogShell` (shared modal chrome) and `ErrorBoundary`.
- All modals render through `DialogShell`: it owns the scrim overlay,
  ESC-to-close, click-outside, focus trap, focus restoration, and
  `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`. Do not hand-roll modal overlays.
- Wrap fallible subtrees in `ErrorBoundary` so a render error degrades locally
  instead of white-screening the whole app (the root is wrapped in `App.tsx`).
- Pull cohesive workbench command/state orchestration out of the
  `AppWorkbench` shell into kebab-case controller hooks under
  `apps/desktop/src/app/controllers/`, such as `use-editor-commands.ts`,
  `use-result-export.ts`, and `use-workspace-actions.ts`.
- Keep `apps/desktop/src/app/hooks/` for UI-local extracted hooks whose naming
  already follows the older camelCase pattern, such as result-grid scroll,
  filtering, and selection helpers. New cross-feature orchestration should use
  `controllers/`; new UI-local hooks should stay near the UI surface or in
  `hooks/` when they are shared inside `src/app`.
- Split multi-tab dialogs into one component per tab (e.g.
  `features/settings/tabs/`); the dialog file stays a thin shell.
- Use the design tokens in `styles/base.css` for spacing, radius, and
  elevation (`--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--elevation-*`) instead of ad-hoc px,
  and theme color tokens instead of hardcoded colors.
- Add or change Tauri payloads in Rust first, then regenerate TypeScript.

## Backend Shape

Tauri owns local privileged work. The frontend should not know driver details,
secret storage details, or streaming/paging internals.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  lib["src-tauri/src/lib.rs<br/>Tauri builder and command registration"]
  state["Managed state<br/>DbState JobState SecurityState AiState PtyState"]
  dbmod["db module<br/>commands, connection, query, stream, spill, meta, edit"]
  engine["engine adapters<br/>postgres mysql sqlite mssql duck snowflake ..."]
  git["git module<br/>status, log, diff, branch, push/pull"]
  pty["pty module<br/>integrated terminal sessions"]
  jobs["jobs module<br/>desktop job commands"]
  ai["ai module<br/>local generation state"]
  security["security module<br/>audit and redaction state"]
  crates["shared crates<br/>completion proxy io generate server"]

  lib --> state
  lib --> dbmod
  lib --> git
  lib --> pty
  lib --> jobs
  lib --> ai
  lib --> security
  dbmod --> engine
  dbmod --> crates
  ai --> crates
  jobs --> crates
```

Backend rules of thumb:

- Add a Tauri command only when the UI needs a privileged/local boundary.
- Keep per-engine driver logic in `src-tauri/src/db/<engine>.rs`.
- Keep engine-independent query splitting, result shaping, streaming, and spill
  behavior in `db/query.rs`, `db/stream.rs`, and `db/spill.rs`.
- Keep metadata conversion in `db/meta.rs`.
- Keep connection profile normalization and redaction in `db/profile.rs`.
- Keep generated command DTOs serializable with `serde(rename_all =
  "camelCase")` and `ts-rs` where they cross to TypeScript.

## Command And Type Boundary

Rust is the source of truth for desktop command payloads. TypeScript consumes
generated bindings rather than hand-writing copies.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  rust["Rust structs/enums<br/>serde + ts-rs"]
  tests["cargo test export_typescript_bindings"]
  generated["apps/desktop/src/generated/irodori-api.ts"]
  ui["React features"]
  extRust["../irodori-kit/irodori-extension"]
  extGenerated["../irodori-kit/packages/extension-sdk/src/generated"]
  sdk["../irodori-kit/packages/extension-sdk"]
  check["typegen drift check<br/>npm run typegen:check"]

  rust --> tests --> generated --> ui
  extRust --> tests --> extGenerated --> sdk
  generated --> check
  extGenerated --> check
```

Use these commands:

```sh
make desktop-typegen
make desktop-typegen-check
make desktop-build-verified
```

## Query Execution Flow

The query path is intentionally Rust-heavy so large result sets, cancellation,
and disk offload stay bounded.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Editor as QueryEditorPane
  participant App as AppWorkbench
  participant API as generated irodori-api.ts
  participant Tauri as Tauri command
  participant DB as DbState / db module
  participant Conn as Connection trait
  participant Grid as ResultsPane

  Editor->>App: run current / selection / all
  App->>API: dbRunQueryStream or dbRunQuerySpill
  API->>Tauri: invoke command
  Tauri->>DB: validate profile, query, limits
  DB->>Conn: execute through engine adapter
  Conn-->>DB: rows, metadata, elapsed time
  DB-->>API: stream events or spill handle
  API-->>App: result sets or windowed result
  App->>Grid: build result view model
  Grid->>API: dbResultWindow when spilled pages are needed
```

Important implementation details:

- `db_run_query_stream` streams batches for fast first paint.
- `db_run_query_spill` writes huge results to a bounded Rust-side result store.
- `db_result_window` pages spilled results back into the grid.
- `db_cancel` cancels active work through cancellation tokens.
- The UI result grid handles sorting/filtering/editing for resident results.
- Spilled results are browse-first; server-side sort/filter is a separate
  workflow.

## Shared Crate Layers

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  app["apps/desktop/src-tauri"]
  server["irodori-server"]
  extension["irodori-extension"]
  core["irodori-core"]
  connection["irodori-connection"]
  security["irodori-security"]
  proxy["irodori-proxy"]
  secureStore["irodori-secure-store"]
  completion["irodori-completion"]
  generate["irodori-generate"]
  io["irodori-io"]
  external["external git/crates<br/>irodori-sql, irodori-error, irodori-jobs"]

  app --> core
  app --> completion
  app --> generate
  app --> io
  app --> proxy
  app --> secureStore
  app --> external
  server --> core
  server --> external
  extension --> external
  core --> connection
  core --> security
  core --> external
  proxy --> core
  secureStore --> core
  completion --> external
  generate --> external
  io --> core
  io --> external
```

Do not add a crate just because a future feature sounds independent. Start
inside the owning app or crate, then split when there is a stable API, separate
test cadence, or a real second consumer.

## Extension Surface

Extensions are intentionally not the same as app internals.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  manifest["irodori.extension.json"]
  sdk["TypeScript SDK<br/>../irodori-kit/packages/extension-sdk"]
  generated["generated extension API"]
  host["desktop extension host/store"]
  app["workbench commands/results/themes"]

  manifest --> sdk
  generated --> sdk
  sdk --> host
  host --> app
```

Extension rules:

- Public extension payloads belong in `../irodori-kit/irodori-extension`.
- SDK convenience wrappers belong in
  `../irodori-kit/packages/extension-sdk/src`.
- App-only plugin registry and loading state belongs under
  `apps/desktop/src/features/extensions`.
- Templates must stay permissively licensed and validate through
  `make extension-manifests`.

## Parallel Agent Development

Parallel work is organized around explicit workstreams rather than informal file
ownership. The detailed policy lives in
[`parallel-agent-architecture.md`](parallel-agent-architecture.md), and the
machine-readable source is
[`registry/agent-workstreams.json`](https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-table/blob/main/registry/agent-workstreams.json).

The key split is:

- One coordinator agent owns registry and generated-catalog source files:
  `knowledge/engines.json`, `registry/catalog/*.json`, and
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/db/engine.rs`.
- Connector agents are repeatable and own exactly one generated sibling
  repository under `../irodori-extensions/irodori-extension-*`.
- Extension-host, DB-runtime, migration/diff, and workbench-UI agents own
  separate source trees and serialize changes only when shared contracts move.
- Generated outputs are changed by the owner of the generator input, not by
  downstream agents.

Validate the workstream map with:

```sh
node tools/docs/agent-workstreams.mjs
```

## Adding A Feature

1. Decide the owner.
   - UI workflow: `apps/desktop/src/features/<area>`.
   - Local privileged action: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/<area>`.
   - Stable shared model: an existing crate, not a new crate by default.
2. If TypeScript calls Rust, define or update the Rust DTO/command first.
3. Regenerate bindings with `make desktop-typegen`.
4. Wire the UI through `generated/irodori-api.ts`, not handwritten invoke calls.
5. Add focused unit tests near the owning feature.
6. Run the smallest relevant checks, then broaden if the boundary changed.

Typical checks:

```sh
make desktop-typegen-check
npm --prefix apps/desktop test
npm --prefix apps/desktop run build
cargo test --workspace
```

## Current Refactor Pressure Points

These areas work but should be watched because they are high-change/high-size:

- `apps/desktop/src/app/AppWorkbench.tsx`: integration point. Move feature logic
  into hooks, stores, or feature components when touching it.
- `apps/desktop/src/features/connections/connection-transfer.ts`: importer
  coverage is broad. Keep parsers test-backed.
- `apps/desktop/src/sql/completion.ts`: completion logic should continue moving
  toward `irodori-completion` when it becomes engine-independent.
- `apps/desktop/src/theme/index.ts`: theme normalization should stay data-driven.
- `apps/desktop/src/features/results/components/WebGlResultGrid.tsx`: rendering
  behavior should stay isolated from result model construction.

## Architecture Guardrails

- `apps/desktop` is allowed to orchestrate product UX.
- `crates/*` should not know about React, Tauri windows, or app layout.
- Rust command payloads should use camelCase at the JSON/TS boundary.
- Long-running work should expose progress/cancel/logs through jobs.
- Huge data should stream or spill; do not buffer full result sets in the UI.
- Secret values should not be logged, copied into generated bindings, or stored
  in plain frontend state.
- Reference-project research belongs in docs or requirements, not copied code.
