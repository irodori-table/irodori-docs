Long description:

> Irodori Table is an open-source desktop database workbench built with Rust,
> Tauri, React, and CodeMirror. It focuses on fast SQL editing, schema-aware
> completion, Vim-friendly keyboard workflows, large-result browsing, query plan
> inspection, import/export, and extension-ready database connectivity.
>
> The app is local-first and does not require a hosted Irodori account. It
> connects to database servers, local files, and optional AI/model providers only
> when configured by the user.
>
> Irodori Table is currently a development preview. Review SQL, backups, and
> target connections before running destructive commands.

## Asset inventory

Current app/repository assets:

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/icon.png`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/icon.icns`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/icon.ico`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/StoreLogo.png`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/Square*.png`
- `src/irodori-icon.svg`

Still needed before store submission:

- screenshots for macOS, Windows, Linux;
- at least one 16:9 product screenshot showing the workbench;
- optional short demo GIF/video for stores that support rich media;
- signed/notarized release artifacts where the channel requires them;
- signed Windows and signed/notarized macOS `v0.7.x` artifacts;
- updater `latest.json` from a successful stable workflow dispatch;
- committed package-manager, desktop-entry, and appstream manifest templates if
  those channels become active.

## Channel checklist

### GitHub Releases

Status: lightweight Linux AppImage lane is live. The stable Windows/macOS/updater
lane is wired in `.github/workflows/release.yml` but blocked on platform signing
and notarization secrets.

Before publishing a release:

- run the release dry run;
- verify generated bindings and frontend build;
- verify release artifacts on each platform;
- fill release notes with known limitations and checksums;
- publish the draft release only after artifact names and signatures are stable.

### Tauri updater

Status: stable workflow lane is wired; publication is blocked until all stable
release signing gates pass.

Needed:

- configure the remaining Windows and macOS signing/notarization secrets;
- dispatch the `stable` workflow for an existing `v*` tag;
- verify updater `latest.json` and signatures before marking the release stable;
- document rollback when an updater artifact is bad.

### Homebrew cask

Status: planned; no template is committed yet.

Create a cask after the macOS release asset and sha256 are available. Submit to
the appropriate tap or to the project-owned tap first.

### Scoop

Status: planned; no template is committed yet.

Create a manifest after the Windows portable zip or installer strategy is
stable. A portable zip is usually cleaner for Scoop than an interactive
installer.

### winget

Status: planned; no template is committed yet.

Create manifests after the Windows installer URL, sha256, publisher name,
installer type, and installer switches are final.

### Chocolatey

Status: planned; no template is committed yet.

Create a package if Chocolatey is a target channel. Keep the install script
non-interactive and checksum-pinned.

### AUR

Status: planned; no template is committed yet.

Create a `PKGBUILD` for `irodori-table-bin` once the Linux AppImage artifact
name and checksum are stable.

### Flatpak / Flathub

Status: design work needed.

Flatpak needs a sandboxed runtime plan, file/network permissions, appstream
metadata, icon assets, and a stable build source. Treat this as a separate
packaging project.

### Snap

Status: design work needed.

Snap needs confinement choices, interface declarations, metadata, and store
review. Treat this as separate from the existing AppImage path.

### crates.io

Status: later.

The current git install path is:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-kit --tag v0.5.0 --locked irodori-server
```

crates.io publication requires all `irodori-*` git/path dependencies to be
published or removed from the publishable crate graph.

## Private doc boundary

Keep this public:

- product description, screenshots, homepage/support/privacy URLs;
- package IDs, release URLs, checksums, and manifest plans;
- public troubleshooting and security-disclosure process.

Keep private:

- Apple Developer, Microsoft Partner Center, Snapcraft, Flathub, Chocolatey, and
  package registry account IDs;
- legal entity details, addresses, phone numbers, tax forms, and banking data;
- signing certificates, private keys, app-specific passwords, notarization
  credentials, API tokens, and recovery codes;
- review conversation history that includes account-specific data;
- release-blocking legal decisions that have not been approved for publication.
