# Repository Boundaries And Archive Policy

This file is the public, repo-local version of the Irodori documentation layout.
Use it when deciding whether a document belongs in `irodori-table`, the public
mdBook, a samples repo, or the private archive.

## Repositories

| Repository              | Visibility           | Owns                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `irodori-table`         | Public               | Desktop app, app-local crates, local knowledge tools, packaging templates, and generated docs consumed by the app/CI.                                                        |
| `irodori-docs`          | Public               | Public mdBook/site, durable user/contributor docs, policy pages, reference pages, feature matrix, backlog/progress views, ADR-style docs, and public long-form explanations. |
| `irodori-samples`       | Public               | Database compose files, seed data, and DB-specific sample query projects.                                                                                                    |
| `irodori-sql`           | Public               | Reusable SQL dialect, placeholder, metamodel, and schema-diff helpers.                                                                                                       |
| `irodori-knowledge`     | Public               | Shared error/job/knowledge crates used by this workspace.                                                                                                                    |
| `irodori-kit`           | Public               | Shared Rust foundation crates, extension SDK, manifest schema, extension-dev helper, generated SDK API, starter templates, and packaging templates.                           |
| `irodori-migration`     | Public               | Execution-free migration planning and schema/data-diff primitives that can be reused outside the desktop app.                                                                |
| `irodori-extension-*`   | Public per connector | One installable connector implementation per repository, usually generated under the local sibling parent `../irodori-extensions/`.                                          |
| `irodori-archive`       | Private              | Historical internal planning/status snapshots, audits, private research notes, bulky discarded docs, and material that should not be public.                                 |

## What Stays In `irodori-table`

- Root project entry points: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md`.
- Generated snapshots that are consumed by tooling or the desktop app:
  `registry/data-source-support-status.md`, selected `registry/cheatsheets/`, and
  `registry/catalog/*.json`.
- Machine-readable coordination files that local tools validate, such as
  `registry/agent-workstreams.json`.
- Short repo-local pointers, such as `docs/README.md` and this boundary policy.

## What Moves To `irodori-docs`

- Stable user guides and contributor guides.
- Public site pages.
- Policy pages: clean-room, licensing, security process, release process.
- Reference pages that should have durable public URLs.
- Feature matrix, implementation progress, backlog, and release-readiness pages.
- ADR-style decisions that explain why the system is shaped a certain way.
- Long-form feature architecture docs, including implementation architecture,
  migration/data-diff, local SQL generation, query plan explorer, integrated
  terminal, headless API, distribution, and store/package registration.

When a page is moved out, keep a local link from `docs/README.md` only if a code
workflow still needs to discover it from this repository.

## What Moves To `irodori-samples`

- `compose.yaml`, seed SQL/JS, and per-engine fixture data.
- DB-specific sample query projects under `projects/<engine>/`.
- `db-feature-samples.json` and sample catalog data.

This repo expects the samples repo as a sibling checkout by default:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-samples ../irodori-samples
```

Override the location with `IRODORI_SAMPLES=/path/to/irodori-samples`.

## What Moves To `irodori-archive`

Archive instead of deleting when the material has historical value but is not a
current public contract:

- superseded implementation plans;
- one-off status reports and audit dumps;
- raw product/research notes;
- internal screenshots or bulky generated exports;
- private planning context that should not be published;
- old docs that confuse current source-of-truth ownership.

Do not link private archive paths from public docs. If public context is needed,
write a short replacement summary in `irodori-docs` or this repo.

## Generated-Doc Flow

Generated docs are edited at their inputs:

| Output                                    | Edit Instead                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registry/data-source-support-status.md`      | `knowledge/engines.json`, `registry/catalog/*.json`, `tools/docs/support-status.mjs` |
| `registry/cheatsheets/*.md`                   | `knowledge/cheatsheets/*.json`, the knowledge DB, `tools/knowledge/cheatsheet.mjs`             |
| `registry/catalog/catalog.json` | `registry/catalog/index.json`, `tools/docs/build-extension-catalog.mjs`              |

Generated snapshots should be mirrored into `irodori-docs` for public reading.
Keep a Markdown snapshot in `irodori-table` only when a local generator, CI guard,
or app-consumed source needs it.

## Parallel Agent Boundary

Use
[parallel-agent-architecture](parallel-agent-architecture.md)
and
[agent-workstreams.json](https://github.com/irodori-table/irodori-table/blob/main/registry/agent-workstreams.json)
when assigning work to
multiple coding agents. The default split is:

- app/runtime/registry contract changes stay in `irodori-table`;
- extension SDK, manifest schema, and template changes stay in `irodori-kit`
  under `packages/extension-sdk`;
- one connector implementation agent writes one `irodori-extension-*` repository;
- generated docs/catalog files are updated by the agent that owns the source
  data or generator;
- shared contracts are serialized through the coordinator workstream.

The check is:

```sh
node tools/docs/agent-workstreams.mjs
```

## Decision Checklist

Before adding a new document, answer:

1. Does app code or tooling consume it? Keep it here.
2. Is it stable public documentation? Put it in `irodori-docs`.
3. Is it a DB fixture or sample query catalog? Put it in `irodori-samples`.
4. Is it historical/private/internal? Put it in `irodori-archive`.
5. Is it generated? Edit the generator or source data, not the output.
